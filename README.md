# Hiking-Tour-Assistant
Develop a smartwatch app to log trip stats: distance, steps, and route. Also, create an external device with a web UI for data analysis and viewing these statistics.

# Steps
1. Run the "main_file_V2.0.ino" from the Final_Code folder.
2. Run the "receiver.py" in Raspberry Pi for the communication and data retrieval, which will generate a data.csv file.
3. Run the "updated_app.py" to run the web UI to monitor the real time data.
